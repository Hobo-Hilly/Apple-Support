Initial Configuration of a NEW MAC

# Summary
In fact on a brand new Mac or on a Mac that you just formatted and didn't install on, like we did in the last episode, the first time you boot it up, you're gonna be greeted with a setup wizard. And the setup wizard is gonna walk you through most of those decisions


- Steps that every user should take immediately following installation
- These are considered the minimum

Basic steps:
    - Migrate previously existing data
    - Configure networking
    - Configure user accounts
    - Adjust general system preferences
    - Configure software updates
Using the Setup Assistant
    - Launched immediately following an installation
    - Provides users with an easy wizard to provide an initial configuration
Items include:
- Region
- Keyboard Definition
- Wi-Fi / Network Configuration
- Migration Assistant
- Apple ID Creation and Sign-In
- Initial Administrative Account Creation
- Warranty / Support Registration
Migration wizard is run upon initial boot of macOS
Can be run at any time
1. Launch Finder
2. Browse to Applications -> Utilities

Can import data from multiple sources
Another Mac
    - Automatically locates other Macs on the network (Wired or wireless)
    - You can connect two Macs via Ethernet cross-over cable
    - You can connect two Macs via Ethernet / USB-C
Basic Steps
1. On source, launch Migration Assistant
2. Choose "To another Mac"
3. On target, launch Migration Assistant
4. Choose "From another Mac"
5. Follow the on-screen instructions

Time Machine Backup
    - Attach a disk to the system containing the Time Machine backup from your previous system
    - Migration Assistant will automatically find the backup and restore your data

Startup Disk
    - Attach the startup disk from your previous system to your new system
    - Several methods available
        - Attach via external connector (USB, Fire-wire)
        - Remove the disk from the old system and install it as an additional disk to your new system (most Macs do not have room for this)
        - Put your old system in "Target Mode" by holding "T" while booting. Then attach the old system to your new system via Fire-wire or Thunderbolt.

Windows PC
    - You must install and run the Migration Assistant on your Windows PC
    - Detailed instructions can be found here
    - The Mac will scan the network until it finds the PC
    - A PIN number is displayed on the PC that must be entered on the Mac for basic authentication

NOTE: There are gonna be times like that where we need to go in and change it and for that we have our system preferences. This is probably one of the most important tools of this whole show because it's where you can figure how your Mac functions. 


# How do I get to System Preferences?
- From the desktop go to the apple icon (top left hand corner)
- Select System Preferences 

When you are in System Preferences USE the search bar in the top right hand corner to search key words for settings you want to find! :) 

Five Categories of System Preferences
- Personal
    - Settings that affect the user experience
Typical Items
    - Desktop & Screen Saver
    - Dock
    - Language & Region
    - Notifications

NOTE: If I log out and log in with a different user account, they may have completely different settings. 
They may have dark mode with Siri turned on, but then log out log in as me and its light mode with Siri turned off. These are personal settings

=========== There is a Dividing line in the middle of this menu to distinguish between individual profile settings located on top and the system wide settings being on the bottom half of the very light grey line. ===========
