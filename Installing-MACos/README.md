# Summary 
In this episode we're gonna use it. So we'll see how to perform an install, how to boot from removable media, how to perform the clean install some of the configuration options and troubleshooting steps we can perform along the way. And hopefully by the end of the episode we've installed Mac OS.

==============================================================================================================


Installation considerations

- The macOS installation process is fairly straightforward
Boot from the installation media and click next a series of times
Installing through the app store is practically automatic
There are some customizations available
Especially true with a clean install
- Performing a Clean Install of macOS
1. Boot from installation media
2. Hold Option during boot if necessary
3. Select your preferred language
4. Choose Install macOS
5. Install macOS - Perform an installation.
6. Select Continue
    * Review and accept the EULA by clicking Agree
7. Select a hard drive to install to
Note that the installation media may show up also
Select Install to complete the installation
macOS Disk Layout
- A file system "container" is created
- Virtual volumes are created to store the OS and user data on one drive
- Finding information is easier as there is one place to look
- Upgrades are more simple as files are in their default location
- Most common type of installation
Multiple partitions can facilitate several scenarios
- Running multiple OSes side-by-side (dual-boot)
- Separating user and system data
- Restricting file growth
- Isolating data for easy backup selection
- Providing for alternate file systems
Bootcamp
- Multiple partitions allow for multiple operating systems
- Bootcamp leverages this to enable macOS and Windows to coexist
- Separate partitions ensure one OS does not damage the other's files
- Separate partitions allow for each OS to use their native file system
Considerations
- Separating user and system data can make it more simple to locate information
- Backups are smaller and faster because you only backup the user data disk
- Can create problems with some software as well as future upgrades
Installer Log
- Available in the macOS Installer menu bar
